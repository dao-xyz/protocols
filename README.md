# WeStake - Social media app on Solana

## Combining social media and staking
- Protocol handles creation of posts, channels and users
- Content is stored on distributed file servers (IPFS).
- Assets are staked behind the scenes to create passive rewards.
- Every post issues three tokens. Ownership, Upvote and downvote token. Ownership token corresponds to a fractionalized ownership of the content. Buying one of these corresponds to an upvote or downvote action.

## Post mechanics
Upon creation of a *post*, three tokens are issued: "Ownership", "Upvote" and "Downvote". Upvote and downvote will be purchased risk free (can be bought and sold for same price at any time). By holding Upvote or Downvote tokens, you are "staking", or validating content using PoS. This means that it will also will be possible to recieve returns from the trading activities from trading activities of the underlying ownership token. 

By connecting upvotes and downvotes to real value, relevance on the platform well be automatically moderated. Users will be motivated to liquidate their positions in content that is not relevant, as elapsed or by that the content itself prove to be false, or non-proven), in order to take more relevant positions (in order to earn rewards through higher trading activities of the underlying).

### Content is unique and immutable
The content of the posts has to be unique. The post creator will not be permitted to create a post if someone else has previously created the same content. Instead it is better to upvote or downvote previous post again.

Content is immutable. But deletion can happen, see below.

### Content moderation, legal vs illegal.
Not all content is legal. Information and data that is deemed illegal by common law is to also be moderated on the platform. This will be handled symbolically in the same way illegal companies are handled. The owner tokens of the illegal content will be liquidated. The value that is liquidated will be distributed in two ways. First, a portion will be burnt to pay symbolically for the damage done to the community. A portion will be put to increase the value of the downvote tokens. 

The authority, custodian service, that deletes the post, will not be compensated by their action (to prevent malicious custodians). Instead custodians have ownership of governance tokens which are valued proportionally to a treasury. This gives incentives to moderate well, as the value of the treasury (which is built by collecting fees) increases when more users are using the platform.
