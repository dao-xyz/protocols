# StakeTogether -  One-stop place for governing Web3 projects
Stake Together is a staked social media trying to bring services like Discord and Reddit to Web3 and providing utility to control Web3 projects in a truly decentralized and transparent way.
 
## Combining social media and staking
- Protocol handles creation of posts, channels and users
- Content is stored on distributed file servers (IPFS).
- Every post issues two tokens: Upvote and downvote token. Votes can have expiry and actions that are performed on expire.
 
## Channels for DAOs
The channels on the platform are intended to serve as communication channels for governance token holders. Posts that exist on the channel are intended to serve as a way of communicating information and/or perform actions after voting.
 
Upvote and downvote can be acquired by swapping governance tokens. This means that voting power will by default be proportional to the stake owners have in organizations.
 
If a user creates an informational post, the post has no expiry time, and voting can be seen as a measure of quality.
 
If a user creates a post to perform an action within an organization, then the vote decides whether the action should happen or not.
 
## Channels for non-DAOs (social media channels)
Channels do not necessarily have to be associated with a DAO. The protocol is providing a platform wide utility token that can be used on non-DAO channels (for voting) and on DAO channels that allow non-owners to participate.
 
 
## Content moderation
Not all content is legal. Information and data that is deemed illegal by common law is to also be moderated on the platform. This will (can) be handled symbolically in the same way illegal companies are handled.
 
Do remove content (posts) on a channel owned by a DAO a post with a "delete" action should be created. Voting on this will determine whether the post will be deleted or not.
 
There has to also be a global governing control to prevent illegal content to threaten the existence of the entire protocol itself. The protocol will control itself through its own DAO channel where these actions can be performed, by the owners of this protocol.
