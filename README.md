# WeStake - Social media app on Solana

## MVP idea

- Protocol handles creation of posts, channels and users
- Content is stored on distributed file servers (IPFS).
- Assets are staked behind the scenes to create yearly returns.
- Every post issues two currencies, upvote and downvote token. Buying these is equivalent of upvoting or downvoting
